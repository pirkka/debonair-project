# Debonair Project

Modern turn-based roguelike with ASCII-style graphics for characters and items. 

Currently developed for controller support as the primary input method.

Touch screen and/or kbd/mouse might be added later, but are not a priority at the moment.

## Running

Double click the ./dragonruby executable to start up the game.

## Source code

Source code is located at ./mygame/app/main.rb.

## Contributions
